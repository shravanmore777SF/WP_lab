            <h2>CSS Grid Revolutionizes Web Layouts</h2>
            <p>
                In a stunning turn of events, web developers everywhere are ditching their old float-based layouts for the power and precision of CSS Grid. 
                "It's simply unprecedented," says lead developer Jane Doe. "We can now align items in two dimensions simultaneously." 
                The new standard allows for complex magazine-style layouts that were previously impossible without heavy frameworks. 
                This article serves as the main feature, occupying the prime real estate of the page to catch the reader's eye immediately.

            <h2>Flexbox: Friend or Foe?</h2>
            <p>
                While Grid takes the spotlight, the humble Flexbox remains a vital tool in the developer's toolkit. 
                Experts suggest using Grid for the main layout structure (like this newspaper) and Flexbox for aligning content within those grid items. 
                This secondary piece explores the symbiotic relationship between the two giants of CSS layout modules.
